##BorrowandLend-a-hand

## ðŸŒŽ Inspiration
As the New Year approached, I was feeling overwhelmed by all the clutter in my home. I had so many things that I no longer needed or used, but I didn't know what to do with them. That's when I had an idea - what if I could lend or donate my old things to others who needed them? I decided to create my own platform and was able to declutter my own life while helping others save money and reduce their own clutter.


## What it does
ðŸ‘‰Allows users to authenticate and log into their account
ðŸ‘‰Users can lend their own items to other users and earn credits for doing so
ðŸ‘‰Credits can be redeemed by borrowing items from others
ðŸ‘‰Users can keep track of the items they have lent, borrowed, and the credits they have earned
ðŸ‘‰Users can donate items to others without earning credits
ðŸ‘‰Users can request items from other users on the platform

## How we built it
ðŸ‘‰We built the website using React and Tailwind to create a beautiful frontend
ðŸ‘‰We used Appwrite for the database and backend of the website
ðŸ‘‰We integrated Auth0 for authentication
ðŸ‘‰We utilized Twilio for SMS services, allowing users to send greetings to each other after lending items


## Challenges we ran into
ðŸ‘‰Lack of experience with backend development made it difficult to work on the backend of the website
ðŸ‘‰The Visual Studio Code editor was accidentally formatted during the project, which was a challenge to overcome
ðŸ‘‰Integrating new technologies such as Twilio and Auth0 for the first time was a learning experience, but it was also challenging to learn them quickly
ðŸ‘‰Creating a visually appealing user interface was a challenging task

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the progress we made on the website despite facing several challenges and working with a small team. We were able to implement a significant portion of the features we had planned, and we believe that the website is visually appealing and user-friendly. Considering the limited time and resources we had, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish.

## What's next for Borrowandlend-a-hand
ðŸ‘‰We have many ideas for new features and improvements that we would like to make to the Borrowandlend-a-hand website. Some of the items on our roadmap include:
ðŸ‘‰Adding a donations and requests page to allow users to donate items or request items from others
ðŸ‘‰Implementing a user dashboard where users can edit their personal information and settings
ðŸ‘‰Exploring the use of smart contracts to facilitate the lending and borrowing of items
